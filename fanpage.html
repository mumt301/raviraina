                <p>


                    James Dewitt Yancey (February 7, 1974 â€“ February 10, 2006), better known by the stage names J
                    Dilla and Jay Dee, was an American record producer and rapper who emerged in the mid-1990s
                    underground hip hop scene in Detroit, Michigan, as one third of the music group Slum Village. He was
                    also a member of the Soulquarians, a musical collective active during the late 1990s and early
                    2000s.
                </p>
                <p> Although his life and career were short, J Dilla is widely considered to be one of the most
                    influential and greatest producers in the hip-hop genre. It was described in The
                    Guardian that "his affinity for crafting lengthy, melodic loops peppered with breakbeats and vocal
                    samples took instrumental hip-hop into new, more musically complex realms."</p>

                    Donuts is the second studio album by the American hip hop producer J Dilla, released on February 7,
                    2006, by Stones Throw Records. It was released on the day of his 32nd birthday, three days before
                    his death.
                </p>
                <p> The album was recorded in 2005, largely during J Dilla's extended stay at Cedars-Sinai Medical
                    Center due to complications from thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and lupus. Twenty-nine
                    of the album's thirty-one tracks were recorded in J Dilla's hospital room, using a 45-rpm record
                    player and a Boss SP-303 sampler.</p>
                <p>
                    Donuts received widespread critical acclaim for its dense, eclectic sampling and its perceived
                    confrontation of mortality. Pitchfork placed the album at number 38 on their list of the top 50
                    albums of 2006 and at number 66 on their list of the top 200 albums of the 2000s. In 2020,
                    Rolling Stone ranked the album at 386 in their 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. It is regarded as
                    J Dilla's magnum opus, a classic of instrumental hip hop, and one of the most influential hip hop
                    albums of all time, with artists of many genres citing it as an inspiration.
