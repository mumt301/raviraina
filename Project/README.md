# Simple, Monophonic, Web-Based Synthesizer

## Usage
Use the bottom row of keys on your keyboard to play white notes, and the middle row to play black notes.

Synthesizer controls are on the side of the keyboard, with the ability to change the voice type, attack, release, and octave of the keyboard.

Above the keyboard you have the option to record. Click the record button and recording will begin once you press a key. When you are done, press the record button again.
To play back what you just recorded, click the playback button.

## Discussion

Unfortunately, I was unable to implement the drum sequencer or add polyphonic playback due to the way I approached setting up how my keyboard worked, as well
as limitations of Pizzicato.js.
